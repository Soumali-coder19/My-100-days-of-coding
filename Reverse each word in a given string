Given a String. Reverse each word in it where the words are separated by dots.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "i.like.this.program.very.much"
Output: i.ekil.siht.margorp.yrev.hcum
Explanation: The words "i", "like",
"this", "program", "very", "much"
are all reversed.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "pqr.mno"
Output: rqp.onm
Explanation: Both "pqr" and "mno" are
reversed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reverseWords() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by reversing all the words separated by dots.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
