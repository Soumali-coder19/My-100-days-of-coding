Geek created a random series and given a name geek-onacci series. Given four integers A, B, C, N. A, B, C represents the first three numbers of geek-onacci series. Find the Nth number of the series. The nth number of geek-onacci series is a sum of the last three numbers (summation of N-1th, N-2th, and N-3th geek-onacci numbers)

Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and N.
Output: For each test case, print Nth geek-onacci number

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 3
1 <= A, B, C <= 100
4 <= N <= 10
Example: Input: 
3 
1 3 2 4 
1 3 2 5 
1 3 2 6

Output: 
6 
11 
19
